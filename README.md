# FFRankExtension

**FFRankExtension** is a Chrome extension designed to optimize your fantasy football drafting experience on the Sleeper platform. It seamlessly integrates **ADP (Average Draft Position)** and **vFP (Variation Fantasy Players)** columns directly into the Sleeper draft board, allowing users to **identify undervalued and overvalued players** without relying on external spreadsheets. This extension provides a **smarter, data-driven approach** to drafting by comparing Sleeperâ€™s rankings with aggregated data from multiple fantasy sources.

<em>The data in this project currently is from 2023. It will be updated for the 2025 season</em>

## Features

- **Custom Rank Integration:** Enhances the Sleeper draft interface by adding an **ADP (Average Draft Position)** and **vFP (Variation Fantasy Players)** column, allowing users to spot undervalued and overvalued players by comparing Sleeper's rankings with custom rankings.
- **Column Significance:** **ADP** aggregates draft position data from multiple fantasy sources, including PFF, to determine the optimal draft spot for each player. **vFP** highlights the difference between Sleeper's rankings and the calculated ADP, helping users make informed drafting decisions.
- **Seamless UI Integration:** Designed to fit naturally within the Sleeper interface, ensuring an intuitive and effortless drafting experience.
